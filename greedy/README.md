# Greedy algorithms
Greedy algorithms are used for optimisation problems. The algorithm builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. An optimisation problem can be solved if on every step of the solution, we make a choice that looks best at the moment; resulting in an optimal solution. 

If a Greedy Algorithm can solve a problem, then it generally becomes the best method to solve that problem as the Greedy algorithms are in general more efficient than other techniques like Dynamic Programming. But note that Greedy algorithms cannot always be applied.
